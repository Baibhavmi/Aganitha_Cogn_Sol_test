## I have already  worked on this Covid19 project in a hackathon.
    So the major  problemis faced by me during  the feature selection.
#Procedure:
1. First analyse the count of each feature.
2. Then draw various graph which can influence the training data set during the a minor change in any value.
3. Then drop_out various  columns  which doesn't effect the data set.
4. Then using the one hot encoding by location and infection probability.
5. Then using CNN by Relu activation function.
6. I trained my model.
7. And predicted for testdataset.
